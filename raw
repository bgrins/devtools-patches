 There are several ways that GCLI commands can be localized. The best method
 depends on what context you are writing your command for.
 
 ### Firefox Embedding
 
 GCLI supports Mozilla style localization. To add a command that will only ever
 be used embedded in Firefox, this is the way to go. Your strings should be

 And you should access them using ``let l10n = require("gcli/l10n")`` and then
 ``l10n.lookup(...)`` or ``l10n.lookupFormat()``
 
 For examples of existing commands, take a look in
 ``browser/devtools/webconsole/GcliCommands.jsm``, which contains most of the
 current GCLI commands. If you will be adding a number of new commands, then
 consider starting a new JSM.
