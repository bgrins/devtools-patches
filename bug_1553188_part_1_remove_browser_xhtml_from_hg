Bug 1553188 - Part 1 - remove browser.xhtml from hg

We would typically just do:
> hg mv browser/base/content/browser.xul browser/base/content/browser.xhtml

But since browser.xhtml is already tracked this would prevent history from
bring preserved from browser.xul. What seems to do the trick is doing this
in two steps where we first do:
> hg remove browser/base/content/browser.xhtml

And then separately do the hg mv. This means the browser is broken in between
the two commits, but they are intended to be pushed together and aren't meant
to be bisected.
